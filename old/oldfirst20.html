                 <p>Before beginning this week's reading we suggest you take a couple of minutes to watch
                     this brief introduction to the Old Testament:</p>

                 <h3>Monday(Day 1)</h3>
                 <a class="scripture-reference" href="https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Ge1.1-2.25" target="_blank">Genesis
                     1:1-2:25</a>

                 <p>Genesis 1 and 2 are key chapters for understanding God and His relationship to mankind.
                     These
                     two chapters reveal that God is the sovereign, all-powerful creator of the universe and
                     that He
                     created man in His image. Part of what this means is that we are created to have a
                     relationship
                     with God. </p>

                 <h3>Tuesday(Day 2)</h3>

                 <a class="scripture-reference" href="https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Ge1.3:1-24" target="_blank">Genesis

                 <p>Up until Genesis 3, the world God created was perfect and untarnished by decay. But in
                     this
                     chapter we will see that something has gone horribly wrong. Our first parents, Adam and
                     Eve
                     rebelled against God and brought death and destruction into the world. </p>


                 <h3>Wednesday (Day 3)</h3>
                 <p>Up until Genesis 3, the world God created was perfect and untarnished by decay. But in
                     this
                     chapter we will see that something has gone horribly wrong. Our first parents, Adam and
                     Eve
                     rebelled against God and brought death and destruction into the world. </p>
                 <a class="scripture-reference" href="https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Gen%206-7" target="_blank">Genesis
                     6:5-7:24</a>

                 <p>These passages reveal the continuing effects and sin, showing how the corruption that
                     began in
                     Adam and Eve has spread to all mankind. Within just a few generations, the world had
                     become so
                     corrupt that God was sorry that He had ever created the world. So he decides to destroy
                     his
                     creation, but one man and his family found grace in the eyes of the Lord.</p>

                 <h3>Thursday (Day 4)</h3>

                 <a class="scripture-reference" href="https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Gen%208-9" target="_blank">Genesis
                     8:1-9:17</a>

                 <p>In this passage we will see how God delivered Noah and his family through the flood and
                     established the first of several OT covenants. In this covenant, God promises that He
                     will never destroy the entire earth again by flood. </p>

                 <h3>Friday (Day 5)</h3>

                 <a class="scripture-reference" target="_blank" href="https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Gen%2011:1-9">Genesis
                     11:1-9</a>

                 <p>This passage continues to show man's rebellion against God. It is unclear exactly what
                     these ancient people had in mind when building the tower of Babel, but it is clear that
                     God took it as a sign of arrogance and rebellion. Here we see the orgin of the various
                     languages and ethnic groups that exist across the world. It is interesting to note that
                     what God confuses here in Genesis 11, he eventually reconciles in Revelation 5. </p>

                 <p>This is one of the most important passages in the Old Testament. The call of Abraham and
                     the covnenat that God made
                     with him are keys to understanding God's plan to redeem people from every nation of the
                     earth.</p>


                 <h3>Tuesday (Day 7)</h3>

                 <p>This passages shows how God enters into covenant/partnership with Abraham and his family
                     to bring a redeemer into the world. Be sure to watch the video above to understand the
                     basic covenants that form the Old Testament.</p>


                 <h3>Wednesday (Day 8)</h3>
                 <a class="scripture-reference" href="https://biblia.com/books/esv/Ge21:1-22:19">Genesis
                     22:1-22:19</a>
                 <p>In this passage Abraham's faith is tested when he is called upon to offer his son as a
                     sacrifice to God. Read Hebrews 11:17-19 to see why Abraham was willing to obey God.</p>


                 <h3>Thursday (Day 9)</h3>
                 <a class="scripture-reference" href="https://biblia.com/books/esv/Ge27:1-28:22">Genesis
                     27:1-28:22</a>
                 <p>These passages show how the covenant with Abraham was passed down to the next
                     generations.</p>

                 <h3> Friday (Day 10)</h3>
                 <a class="scripture-reference" href="https://biblia.com/books/esv/Gen32:1-33:20">Genesis
                     32:1-33:20</a>
                 <p>God is faithful to His covenants even when His people are not. Jacob swindled his brother
                     out of his inheritance, yet God still used him. </p>

                 <a class="scripture-reference" href="https://biblia.com/books/esv/Ge37.1-36">Genesis
                     37:1-36</a>
                 <p>The life of Joseph teaches us about the providence of God. There are moments in all of
                     our lives when we feel that God has abandoned us. Joseph had many opportunties where he
                     could have fallen into despair. But the Bible shows us that God was working behind the
                     scenes to continue his covenant purposes through Jospeh. </p>

                 <h3>Tuesday (Day 12)</h3>
                 <a class="scripture-reference" href="https://biblia.com/books/esv/Ge39.1-41.57">Genesis
                     39:1-41:47</a>
                 <p>Even though he was a young man, living far from home and in very trying circumstances,
                     Joseph maintained his purity in spite of enormous temptation. Eventually Jospeh is given
                     the opportunity to use his gifts and God raised him to the second highest position in
                     Egypt. </p>

                 <h3>Wednesday (Day 13</h3>
                 <a class="scripture-reference" href="https://biblia.com/books/esv/Ge42.1-38">Genesis
                     42:1-38</a>
                 <p>While the events in this book may have felt random to Joseph and his family, they were
                     all part of God's larger plan of redemption. Through the cirucmstances in Joseph's life,
                     God placed him in exactly the right place and position to accomplish God's plan. </p>

                 <h3>Thursday (Day 14</h3>
                 <a class="scripture-reference" href="https://biblia.com/books/esv/Ge43.1-44.32">Genesis
                     43:1-44:34</a>
                 <p>The theme of substitution is essential to understanding the Gospel and we can find it
                     throughout the Scripture. In Genesis 3:21, God substituted an animal in place of Adam
                     and Eve, using the skins to cover their nakedness. Later in the Old Testament we will
                     see that the idea of a substitute being offered our sin is the basis for the sacrificial
                     system Exodus and Leviticus. In our reading today, notice that Judah offers to take the
                     place of his brother. All of this prepares us for the ultimate, perfect sacrifice made
                     for our sins by Jesus (see Hebrews 9:11-14).</p>


                 <h3>Friday (Day 15)</h3>

                     45:1-46:7</a>
                 <p>These passages explain how the Israelites came to be in Egypt, preparing the way for the
                     book of Exodus.</p>

                 <p>Exodus begins with the children of Israel in a desperate state of captivity in Egypt.
                     Having grown concerned about the growing Hebrew population, the Pharoah embarked on a
                     genocidial plan to eliminate the Jewish race. In the midst, of this trying circumstance
                     a deliverer named Moses is born. </p>

                 <h3>Tuesday (Day 17)</h3>

                     allowfullscreen></iframe>

                 <p>By the end of Exodus 2, it appeared as if God's plan had been thwarted by Moses'
                     impetuosity. But nothing could be further from the truth. God used this time in the
                     desert to humble Moses and prepare him for his future vocation. At just the right time
                     and in just the right way, God revealed Himself to Moses in the form of a burning bush.
                 </p>

                 <a class="scripture-reference" href="https://biblia.com/books/esv/Ex6.28-11.10">Exodus
                     6:28-11:10</a>
                 <p>Moses and Aaron were instructed by God to announce to Pharoah a series of plagues that
                     would strike at the very heart of Egypt's religion. First and foremost the Plagues
                     represent a theological battle in which the Lord demonstrates His superiorty over the
                     various Egyptian deities.</p>


                 <h3>Thursday (Day 19)</h3>

                     12:1-42</a>
                 <p>The Exodus from Israel is the pivotal event in the history of Jewish people in the Old
                     Testament. It is the supreme demonstration of God's power to deliver His people in the
                     OT and prepares the way for the coming of Jesus. It is signicant that in the New
                     Testament, Jesus is presented as our Passover lamb (1 Cor 5:7, John 19:14).(</p>

                 <p>In these passages we see God fulfilling His promise to deliver His people from Egypt.
                     Leading His people with a cloud by day and fire by night, God led His people out of
                     Egypt, across the Red Sea and to the promised land. </p>

                 <p>The Ten Commandments represent God's character and outline His righteous demands for His
                     people. The commands can be broken into two sections. The first four establish how we
                     are to honor God, the last six, how we are to treat and live with each other. Jesus
                     summarizes these two sections of the Ten Commandments in Matthew 22:34-40. </p>



                 <h3>Tuesday (Day 22)</h3>
                 <a class="scripture-reference" href="https://biblia.com/books/esv/Ex32.1-34.35">Exodus
                     32:1-34:35</a>
                 <p>These passages introduce us to the constant problem of idolatry among God's people. The
                     Israelites wanted a god that they could see, feel and touch. Basically, idoltary occurrs
                     anytime we look to anyone or anything other than the Lord for our ultimate satisfaction.

                 <a class="scripture-reference" href="https://biblia.com/books/esv/Jos1.1-18">Joshua
                     1:1-18</a>

                 <p>After the death of Moses, the mantle of leadership passed to Joshua. These passages
                     remind us that while God may bury the leader, the work of the Kingdom continues. Joshua
                     is reminded in these passages that his success does not rely on his own strength, but
                     upon the Lord's</p>

                 <h3>Thursday (Day 24)</h3>
                 <a class="scripture-reference" href="https://biblia.com/books/esv/Jos3.1-4.24">Joshua
                     3:1-4:24</a>
                 <p>Due to their sin, the wilderness generation was forbidden from entering the promised
                     land. But God is faithful to His covenant and in these chapters we see Him fulfilling
                     His promises by crossing the Jordan river and bringing the people into the promised
                     land. </p>


                 <h3>Friday (Day 25)</h3>
                 <a class="scripture-reference" href="https://biblia.com/books/esv/Jos5.13-6.27">Joshua
                     5:13-6:27</a>
                 <p>The success of God's Kingdom never rests in the hands of man. In their first battle for
                     the conquest of the promised land, Israel faced an overwhelming obstacle - the walled
                     city of Jericho. God's instructions to them make no military sense, but when carried out
                     by faith, result in an incredbile victory</p>

                <h4>Israel's Disobedience</h4>
                    <a class="scripture-reference" href="https://biblia.com/books/esv/Jdg2.6">Judges 2:6-3:6</a><br><br>

                    <p>God's people are in constant need of renewal and revival.  It did not take long after the death of Joshua for the people to begin falling into the sins of the nations around them.  Throughout the book of Judges, God responds to the backsliding of His people by giving them into the hands of their enemies, which results in repentance and renewal after they return to Him.</p>

                <h3>Tuesday(Day 27)</h3>
                    <h4>Deborah Leads Israel</h4>
                    <a class="scripture-reference" href="https://biblia.com/books/esv/Jdg4.1-5.31">Judges 4:1-5:31</a><br><br>
                    <p>Deborah represents one of the many women that God uses in the Old Testament. This passage refers to Deborah as a prophetess, meaning that she spoke on behalf of God, but she also serves in the role of Judge/deliverer.  She confronts a man named Barak, who had been instructed by God to do battle against the Canaanites but was too cowardly to carry out the command. </p>

                <h3>Wednesday(Day 28)</h3>
                    <h4>Gideon Defeats the Midianites</h4>
                    <a class="scripture-reference" href="https://biblia.com/books/esv/Jdg6.1-7.25">Judges
                        6:1-7:25</a><br><br>
                    <p>Gideon is a reluctant servant, but God still uses him to deliver the Israelites from the hands of the Midianites. With a small band of solidiers and an unlikely battle plan, God delivers the nation and defeats a much larger and better equipped army.</p>

                <h3>Thursday (Day 29)</h3>
                    <h4>Samson Defeats the Philistines</h4>
                    <a class="scripture-reference" href="https://biblia.com/books/esv/Jdg13.1-16.31">Judges 13:1-16:31</a><br><br>
                    <p>Samson is one of the most well known figures in the Old Testament.  God supernaturally empowered Samson to deliver the people of Israel from their enemies, but in the end Samsons own sinful nature caused his downfall.</p>
                <h3>Friday (Day 30)</h3>
                <h4>The Story of Ruth</h4>
                <a class="scripture-reference" href="https://biblia.com/books/esv/Ru1.1-4.22">Ruth 1:1-4:22</a><br><br>
                <p>Ruth is one of the greatest pictures of the Gospel in the Old Testament. Being a Gentile, she was born outside of the people of God, but Ruth comes into the covenant by way of marriage.  But even after her husband dies, Ruth chooses to be loyal to her mother-in-law, Naomi, and is eventually redeemed by a man named Boaz. This story links to the eventual genealogy of Jesus because Boaz is the great grandfather of King David. </p>

                <h3>Monday (Day 31)</h3>
                <h4>Samuel Listens to God</h4>
                <a class="scripture-reference" href="https://biblia.com/books/esv/1Sa1.1-3.21">1 Samuel 1:1-3:21</a><br><br>

                <p>The book of Samuel transitions from the time of the Judges to the beginning of the Hebrew monarchy under Saul. In this section we are introduced to Hannah and Elkanah, an ordinary Hebrew couple, whom God used in an extraordinary way.  We are also introduced to Eli, the priest and negligent father, along with his corrupt sons. </p>
                <h3>Tuesday (Day 32)</h3>
                <h4>King Saul</h4>
                <a class="scripture-reference" href="https://biblia.com/books/esv/1Sa8.1-10.27">1 Samuel 8:1-10:27</a><br><br>
                <p>Saul represents the people's choice.  He was selected to be King because of his height, good looks and wealthy family.  But Saul consistently demonstrates a character that is unfitting for a King.</p>
                <h3>Wednesday (Day 33)</h3>
                <h4>David and Goliath</h4>
                <a class="scripture-reference" href="https://biblia.com/books/esv/1Sa16.1-18.16">1 Samuel 16:1-18:16</a><br><br>
                <p>While Saul and the armies of Israel cower in fear, David steps to the forefront and takes on the giant Goliath. While David is the human instrument in this story, he is not the hero.  The true hero in the story is God, to whom David gives all of the glory for the victory.</p>
                <h3>Thursday (Day 34)</h3>
                <h4>David and Saul</h4>
                <a class="scripture-reference" href="https://biblia.com/books/esv/1Sa23.7-24.22">1 Samuel 23:7-24:22</a><br><br>
                <p>David's success and acclaim caused Saul to turn against him.  Throughout the next several chapters, Saul consistently makes David his enemey, but David never responds to the temptation to turn on Saul.  He consistently remains committed to allowing God to work His plan, in His timing.</p>
                <h3>Friday (Day 35)</h3>
                <h4>King David</h4>
                <a class="scripture-reference" href="https://biblia.com/books/esv/2Sa5.1-7.29">2 Samuel 5:1-7:29</a>

                <p>David is finally installed as King of Israel and begins his reign. In these first few years of his reign, David consolidates his government, establishes Jerusalem as his captial and demonstrates his commitment to God by bringing the Ark of the Covenant to the city.</p>

                <h4>David and Bathsheba</h4>
                <a class="scripture-reference" href="https://biblia.com/books/esv/2Sa11.1-12.25">2 Samuel 11:1-12:25</a><br><br>

                <p>In this passage we see King David's most famous failure.  This reminds us that even though God has promised to bring the Messiah into the world through David's line, he was still human.  David encountered serious consequences as a result of his sin, but received God's forgivness and grace when he was willing to repent. </p>


                <h3>Tuesday (Day 37)</h3>
                <h4>King Solomon</h4>
                <a class="scripture-reference" href="https://biblia.com/books/esv/1Ki2.1-38">1 Kings 2:1-3:28</a><br><br>

                <p>King Solomon takes the throne after his father, David, dies.  At the very beginning of his reign, God offers to give Solomon anything that he asked. Rather than asking for riches and material goods, Solomon merely asked God to grant him the wisdom to lead the people well.  As a result, God granted both wisdom and wealth to Solomon.</p>
            
                
                <h3>Wednesday (Day 38)</h3>
                <h4>David and Saul</h4>
                <a class="scripture-reference" href="https://biblia.com/books/esv/1Ki8.1-9.9">1 Kings 8:1-9:9</a><br><br>
                <p>In this passage, Solomon brings the Ark of the Covenant into the newly constructed Temple. This became the center of worship for the Israelites and a picture of the true Temple in heaven. </p>
                
                <h3>Thursday (Day 39)</h3>
                <h4>Elijah and the Prophets of Baal</h4>
                <a class="scripture-reference" href="https://biblia.com/books/esv/1Ki16.29-19.18">1 Kings 16:29-19:18</a><br><br>
                <p>After the death of Solomon the nation of Israel divided into two Kingdoms- the Norther portion was still called Israel, while the Southern Kingdom was known as Judah. Idolatry was a constant problem in both portions.  Ahab, the most wicked King in Israel's history, married a Sidonian princess named Jezebel.  She heavily promoted the worship of Baal, leading to the conflict between the prophet Elijah and the followers of Baal on Mt. Carmel.  </p>


                <h3>Friday (Day 40)</h3>
                <h4>The Fall of Jerusalm</h4>
                <a class="scripture-reference" href="https://biblia.com/books/esv/2Ki25.1-30">2 Kings 25:1-30</a>
                <p>After decades of spiritual decline and increasing idolatry, God brought judgment upon the nation of Israel by sending the Assyrian army to conquer and carry them into captivity.  The nation of Judah, refusing to learn the lesson from their neighbor to the North, continued in a downward spirtual slide until they too were taken into captivity by the Babylonians. </p>
