Disciple Maker�s Group Leader Guide










Your weekly meetings should focus on Four elements:
1. Bible Study- Read the Word together. Discuss your Bible reading for the week and have each member share a HEAR journal entry.
2. Memorize Scripture- Go over your memory verses for the week and make sure each person has memorized their verses.  (If you have introduced Scripture Memory Immediately) 
3. Accountability- Ask questions of each other. Take notes on individuals who have spiritual growth goals around your basic group questions.  For example; �Bill, how are you doing with the anger problem you told us about?�
4. Pray-Record 1 prayer request from each member and pray over these requests together. Also, each member should submit the name of one person they are praying to see become a Christian. 

Note: Chapters 3-10 of Growing Up will be read by group members as you begin the Discipleship journey together. You will read 1 Chapter per week in your group. In your group meetings, briefly go over the current chapter using the questions provided in the book.  Make sure your group members are understanding and implementing the Spiritual Exercises described in chapters 5-10. These spiritual exercises (sometimes called Spiritual Disciplines) are at the heart of the discipleship process.
