Disciple Maker�s Group Leader Guide

Week 1:  Set your first weekly meeting time and have group members read the Introduction through Chapter 3 of �Growing Up� before the first meeting.  The material they read in that portion of the book will explain the commitment they are about to make before they sign the Disciple-Making Covenant. 
* Go over the Disciple-Making Covenant in appendix 1 (page 161-162) and explain the commitment you are all making to each other. Give each member a printed covenant. Have the group members sign the printed covenant and then you as the leader keep them. Also, sign each person�s covenant in their book. This way, you as the leader keep a copy and the group member has a copy of the signed commitment. Have one group member sign your commitment as well. 
* Go over the accountability questions you will use in your group each week. A sample set of questions is in appendix 7 (p 175) of your Growing UP book.  Feel free to customize the questions to better fit your group.
* Explain the 100 day Bible reading plan in appendix 4 (167) & set a start date for your group.  This reading plan is a 100 day overview of the entire Bible.
* Ask your group to begin a �HEAR� notebook. A sample HEAR entry is in appendix 3 (p 165). The HEAR process will be explained more fully later. For now, ask your group members to do at least 1 HEAR Journal entry per week and be prepared to share it in the group. 
* Assign Book reading Chapter 4 for next week and introduce the memory verse. If you are starting with scripture memory in your group, there is a memory verse for each week at the end of every chapter. (Depending upon the makeup of your group, you may want to ease them into daily reading and accountability for a while before introducing scripture memory.)
* Ask each member to share a brief testimony of how they met Jesus.  This is a great way for group members to better get to know one another.  It also allows you to make sure everyone in your group has come to saving faith in Jesus. If time is short, just share yours and let the group know they will share next week. Either way, go first to set the example.
* Ask each group member to share a name of a person they are praying for that needs to become a Christian. Also, allow for 1 prayer request per person each week. This will limit and focus your prayer time to the most pressing needs of each person. Record those prayers and follow up each week. Celebrate the answered prayers and continue praying for the lost until they are brought to saving faith in Jesus.  Close in prayer.

Your weekly meetings should focus on Four elements:
1. Bible Study- Read the Word together. Discuss your Bible reading for the week and have each member share a HEAR journal entry.
2. Memorize Scripture- Go over your memory verses for the week and make sure each person has memorized their verses.  (If you have introduced Scripture Memory Immediately) 
3. Accountability- Ask questions of each other. Take notes on individuals who have spiritual growth goals around your basic group questions.  For example; �Bill, how are you doing with the anger problem you told us about?�
4. Pray-Record 1 prayer request from each member and pray over these requests together. Also, each member should submit the name of one person they are praying to see become a Christian. 

Note: Chapters 4-10 of Growing Up will be read by group members as you begin the Discipleship journey together. You will read 1 Chapter per week from weeks 2-8 in your group. In your group meetings, briefly go over the current chapter using the questions provided in the book.  Make sure your group members are understanding and implementing the Spiritual Exercises described in chapters 5-10. These spiritual exercises (sometimes called Spiritual Disciplines) are at the heart of the discipleship process.
