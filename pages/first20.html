                         <p>Genesis 1 and 2 are key chapters for understanding God and His relationship to mankind.
                             These
                             two chapters reveal that God is the sovereign, all-powerful creator of the universe and

                             created man in His image. Part of what this means is that we are created to have a

                              God took it as a sign of arrogance and rebellion. Here we see the orgin of the various
                              languages and ethnic groups that exist across the world. It is interesting to note that
                              what God confuses here in Genesis 11, he eventually reconciles in Revelation 5. </p>

This is one of the greatest pictures of Christ in the Old Testament.  The lamb that takes Isaac's place is a symbol of the way the Jesus would later become our subsitute on the cross.</p>

                        <p>The theme of substitution is essential to understanding the Gospel and we can find it
                            throughout the Scripture. In Genesis 3:21, God substituted an animal in place of Adam
                            and Eve, using the skins to cover their nakedness. Later in the Old Testament we will
                            see that the idea of a substitute being offered our sin is the basis for the sacrificial
                            system Exodus and Leviticus. In our reading today, notice that Judah offers to take the
                            place of his brother. All of this prepares us for the ultimate, perfect sacrifice made
                            for our sins by Jesus (see Hebrews 9:11-14).</p>

                        <p>Ruth is one of the greatest pictures of the Gospel in the Old Testament. Being a Gentile,
                            she was born outside of the people of God, but Ruth comes into the covenant by way of
                            marriage. But even after her husband dies, Ruth chooses to be loyal to her mother-in-law,
                            Naomi, and is eventually redeemed by a man named Boaz. This story links to the eventual
                            genealogy of Jesus because Boaz is the great grandfather of King David. </p>

                            human. In spite of David's great failure he still received mercy and forgiveness when he

                            reign, the Lord offered to give Solomon anything he asked. But rather than asking for riches
                            and material goods, Solomon asked God to grant him the wisdom to lead the people
                            well. This is a picture of the wisdom and humility which the Messiah would later
                            demonstrate.
                            As a result of Solomon's request, God granted him both wisdom and great wealth. But as we

                            allow
                            him to build it. In today's passage, Solomon brings the Ark of the Covenant into the temple
