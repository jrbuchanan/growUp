        <h1>Why Be Part of a Discipleship Group?</h1>
        <p>In Matthew 28:19, Jesus told his disciples to, "Go therefore and make disciples of all nations..." This command was intended not just for the original twelve Apostles, but for every follower of Christ, in every age.  The problem is that while we know we are called to a deeper relationship with Jesus and to make an eternal investment in the lives of others, we have no idea where to begin. The good news is that you are not alone. God has placed us within a community of believers for a reason.</p>

        <p>The New Testament model of discipleship involves small groups of believers meeting togther for the purpose of mutual encouragement, growth and accountability.  By becoming part of a Discipleship Group you are making the commitment of going beyond mere Christinanity, to becoming a disciple-maker.  This process is not easy.  It will require a sacrifice of time and effort on your part.  You will be required to step out of your comfort zone and deepen your walk with Jesus like never before. But in the end, God will grow your walk with Him and expand His kingdom through you. 
        
        <p>Below is a short video by Robby Gallaty, author of the book <i>Growing Up</i> explaining why many churches don't take discipleship seriously.  Take a few moments to watch this video and then click on the link to the covenant below to understand more fully what is expected within a group. </p>

            <p><i>Growing Up</i> is a manual for making disciples. It will answer the what, why, where, and how of
                discipleship. Underline in it, write in the margain, interact with it, and meditate on it. You are not
                learning this information for yourself only, although you will definitely benefit from it. You are
                learning for all the people you will disciple in the future. The gospel came to you because it's heading
                to someone else.</p>

        <h1>Disciple Maker's Group Leader Guide</h1>
        <p>
            <h2>Important Things as you begin:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>You are not the "teacher" of your D-Group. The Holy Spirit is! You are not preparing lessons. Simply do the daily devotionals, let God teach you and bring what you learn to the group when you meet.
                </li><br><br>
                <li>FBC recommends you use the ESV translation in both your study and your memorization of scripture. This is the version our pastors use when preaching and teaching.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Week 1 Meeting</h2>Set your first weekly meeting time and have group members read the Introduction through Chapter 1 of
            <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Growing-Up-Disciple-Makes-Disciples/dp/1462729983/ref=sr_1_2?crid=23HD3NH6TU7SG&keywords=robby+gallaty+books&qid=1553554305&s=gateway&sprefix=Robby+Ga%2Caps%2C172&sr=8-2"
                target="_blank">"Growing
                Up"</strong></a>
            before the first meeting. The material they read in that portion of the book will explain the commitment
            they are about to make before they sign the Disciple-Making Covenant.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Go over the <a href="/pages/covenant.html"><strong>Disciple-Making Covenant in appendix 1(page 161-162)</strong></a> and explain
                the commitment
                you are all
                making to each other. Give each member a printed covenant. Have the group members sign the printed
                covenant and then you as the leader keep them. Also, sign each person's covenant in their book. This
                way, you as the leader keep a copy and the group member has a copy of the signed commitment. Have one
                group member sign your commitment as well. </li>
            <li>Go over the <a href="pages/questions.html"><strong>Accountability Questions in appendix 7 (p.175) </strong></a>you will use in your group each week. Feel free to customize the questions to better fit your group.</li>
            <li>Explain the 120 day Bible reading plan in
            <a href="pages/first20.html"><strong>appendix 4 (pg. 167)</strong></a> & set a start date for your group.
            This reading plan is a 100 day overview of the entire Bible. We will assign 5 days a week (allowing for 2
            make up days). </li>
            <li>Ask your group to begin a 'HEAR' notebook. A sample HEAR entry is in <a
                    href="pages/hear.html"><strong>appendix 3 (p 165)</strong></a>. The HEAR process will be explained
                more fully later. For now, ask your group members to do at least 1 HEAR Journal entry per week and be
                prepared to share it in the group. </li>
            <li>Assign Book reading Chapter 2 for next week and introduce the memory verse. If you are starting with
                scripture memory in your group, there is a memory verse for each week at the end of every chapter.
                (Depending upon the makeup of your group, you may want to ease them into daily reading and
                accountability for a while before introducing scripture memory.)</li>
            <li>Ask each member to share a brief testimony of how they met Jesus. This is a great way for group members
                to better get to know one another. It also allows you to make sure everyone in your group has come to
                saving faith in Jesus. If time is short, just share yours and let the group know they will share next
                week. Either way, go first to set the example.</li>
            <li>Ask each group member to share a name of a person they are praying for that needs to become a Christian.
                Also, allow for 1 prayer request per person each week. This will limit and focus your prayer time to the
                most pressing needs of each person. Record those prayers and follow up each week. Celebrate the answered
                prayers and continue praying for the lost until they are brought to saving faith in Jesus. Close in
                prayer.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Your Weekly Meetings Should Focus on Four Elements</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Bible Study- Read the Word together. Discuss your Bible reading for the week and have each member share
                a HEAR journal entry.</li>
            <li>Memorize Scripture- Go over your memory verses for the week and make sure each person has memorized their verses. (If you have introduced Scripture Memory Immediately) </li>
            <li>Accountability- Ask questions of each other. Take notes on individuals who have spiritual growth goals around your basic group questions. For example; "Bill, how are you doing with the anger problem you told us about?"</li>
            <li>Pray-Record 1 prayer request from each member and pray over these requests together. Also, each member
                should submit the name of one person they are praying to see become a Christian. </li>
        </ol>

        <p><strong>Note:</strong> Chapters 3-10 of Growing Up will be read by group members as you begin the Discipleship journey
            together. You will read 1 Chapter per week in your group. In your group meetings, briefly go
            over the current chapter using the questions provided in the book. Make sure your group members are
            understanding and implementing the Spiritual Exercises described in chapters 5-10. These spiritual exercises
            (sometimes called Spiritual Disciplines) are at the heart of the discipleship process.</p>
